A minesweeper game with Java Swing

(a) Pot Luck
Design and implement a GUI application that presents a game based on a 5 by 5
matrix of buttons. One of the buttons (selected at random) "hides" the prize, while
two of the buttons (selected at random, should be different than each other and prize
button) hide bombs. A status bar at the top of the window shows the number of
guesses. When the prize button is pressed, the status bar shows "You got it in x
attempts!". When one of the bomb buttons is pressed, the status bar shows "Sorry!
You are blown up at attempt x!".


(b) Convert Numbers
Design and implement a GUI application that converts decimal, hex and binary
numbers, as shown in the figure below. When you enter a decimal value in the
decimal-value text field and press the Enter key, its corresponding hex and binary
numbers are displayed in the other two text fields. Similarly, you can enter values in
the other fields and convert them accordingly.
